🧠 Core Features
1️⃣ Machine Learning Risk Engine

Implemented a Random Forest classifier to assess disaster risk.

Model inputs include rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

Outputs a percentage-based risk score via a Flask REST API.

2️⃣ Live Weather Data Integration

Fetches real-time environmental data using OpenWeatherMap.

Dynamically feeds processed weather parameters into the ML model.

Enables up-to-date risk assessment for any supported location.

3️⃣ Multi-Layered Geolocation System

Browser-based HTML5 GPS detection.

Reverse geocoding via LocationIQ.

IP-based fallback detection.

Manual city search option for global accessibility.

4️⃣ Automated Alerting System

Integrated Twilio SMS API.

Sends automated alerts when risk thresholds exceed predefined limits.

Demonstrates event-driven backend logic and third-party API integration.

5️⃣ Authentication & User Personalization

Secure login and registration system.

Password hashing using PBKDF2 (werkzeug.security).

User-specific prediction history stored in SQLite.

Session-based filtering for personalized dashboards.

🛡️ Security & Configuration

Sensitive API keys stored securely using .env files.

.gitignore configured to prevent credential exposure.

Backend configured for secure API communication.

Production-ready setup using Gunicorn.

📌 Project Status

This project is a research-oriented prototype built for academic and learning purposes. Predictions are experimental and not intended for real-world emergency decision-making.
